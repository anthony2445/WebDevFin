This was tested in a Windows environment

To Start in command line "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin\mongod.exe"
*Note need folder C:\data\db

Then in a separate cmd navigate to the base_files folder and run "node database.js"
*Not necessary if you would like to register a new username and password

Then run "node lab10.js"
In your browser go to localhost:3001

The main page shows some basic information about the game DOTA2, and has links to the other pages,
and the ability to login or Register

You may want to start with registering a new account, the username and password are stored in the mongodb after they are input

Once you've created an account you can Login (username and password are case sensitive)

When you log in you may notice the comments tab appears,
you can check this section out as well as leave a comment or two if you want.

You can also check out the news page which shows an RSS feed of stories from the official DOTA2 website

And when you're done you can use the Logout button to log out of your account
