To Start in command line "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin\mongod.exe"
Then in a separate cmd navigate to the base_files folder and run "node database.js"
Then run "node lab10.js"
In your browser go to localhost:3001

I've been running npm install every time I update any of the pug Files
I also ran npm install xmlhttprequest (for the AJAX in pug)

Some things that I hit a wall on:
	The image doesn't seem to want to load... I think this might just be a full path problem,
	although we may just want to load a picture from an online source instead

	The news stories won't load, not the biggest deal cause we can just manually
	input some stories but it would be nice to include some AJAX

Then just in general you know more about DOTA than me so whatever you think should be included I'm down to work on.
