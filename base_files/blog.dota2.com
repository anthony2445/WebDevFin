<p>With today&#8217;s update, the butcher&#8217;s got a whole new set of tools as the Pudge Arcana makes its grand debut. Featuring all-new custom animations and effects—including multiple Dismember animations, a Hook Streak counter, hundreds of new VO responses, and more—the Feast of Abscession gives Pudge a host of new ways to sink his hooks into all that fresh meat wandering the battlefield.</p>
<p>After the intense selection process that culminated in Pudge&#8217;s slim Arcana Vote victory at The International, it seems only fair that the triumphant hero recognize his vanquished foe. With that in mind, Pudge can unlock a second style for his Arcana by winning 12 games when opposed by Rubick on the other team. Armed with his new hooks, and even new Rubick-specific VO responses, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before the butcher collects his due.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.dota2.com/feastofabscession/">The Feast of Abscession Update</a> page for more information on all this new Arcana has to offer.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s update unveils Dota Plus, a new monthly subscription service designed to help you get the most out of every match you play.</p>
<p>Dota Plus is an evolution of the Battle Pass. In the past we released two types of Battle Passes, ones that revolved around the Majors, and one around The International. As a result of the recent introduction of the Pro Circuit, we&#8217;ve replaced the Majors Battle Passes with a new type of service that doesn&#8217;t depend on a specific start and end date, and one that we can continually add features and content to over time.</p>
<p>This reimagining of the Majors Battle Pass will be an ongoing, uninterrupted service filled with features that provide both progression and opportunities for improvement. Hero Leveling offers you a way to make progress every match while earning Shards, a new currency that can be used to unlock rewards. Test your skills by completing hundreds of new Challenges of varying difficulties. Use the Plus Assistant to help you make build decisions by utilizing real-time item and ability suggestions. These suggestions are based on data gathered from millions of recent games at each skill bracket, ensuring your builds stay current in the ever-evolving meta. Better understand your playstyle by using new graphs and analysis tools both during the match and after it’s finished.</p>
<p>This update also includes the return of the Battle Cup. All Dota Plus members will have free weekly access to play in the weekend tournaments, while non-members can still purchase tickets for $0.99 to participate. </p>
<p>Everything Dota Plus has to offer is available now for $3.99 per month. Receive a discount if you sign up for a six- or twelve-month subscription. Want to gift Dota Plus to a friend? You can purchase gift memberships that will remain active for a fixed number of months.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.dota2.com/plus">Dota Plus</a> page for more information on all of the features included in your subscription. </p>

<p>The Sundered Moon has always been more famous for its nightly brawls than its seasonal brews. But tonight a new kind of live entertainment steps in, as Awolnation bring their musical stylings to every hero&#8217;s favorite watering hole. Can the spirit of music overcome Ancient-sized grudges? Find out in <a href="http://awolnationmusic.com/dota2">Awolnation&#8217;s new Dota 2 music video</a>, animated by the three-time winner of the Dota 2 Short Film Contest.</p>
<p>For those heroes who like what they hear and want to take a little thrum to their next scrum, Awolnation&#8217;s &#8216;Magic Sticks of Dynamite&#8217; music pack is also available in the Dota 2 store.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve been seeing a bunch of discussion regarding DotaTV and want to expand on what we&#8217;ve said before. </p>
<p>The first issue we&#8217;ve been seeing discussed is regarding DMCA notices. This one is very simple: No one besides Valve is allowed to send DMCA notices for games streamed off of DotaTV that aren&#8217;t using the broadcasters&#8217; unique content (camera movements, voice, etc).</p>
<p>The second issue is regarding who is permitted to cast off of DotaTV. We designed <a href="http://blog.dota2.com/2017/10/broadcasting-dota-2/">the DotaTV guidelines</a> to be flexible in order to allow for up and coming casters, or community figures like BSJ or Bulldog that occasionally watch tournament games on their channel, to be able to stream off of DotaTV. It is not to allow commercial organizations like BTS to compete with the primary stream. It&#8217;ll be our judgment alone on who violates this guideline and not any other third party&#8217;s.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Based on information we’ve recently confirmed regarding new government regulations for esports players entering the Philippines, we have decided to rescind the tournament’s Major designation, including the Pro Circuit qualifying points, for the Galaxy Battles 2018 tournament.  This is based on what we feel are unreasonable infringements on the privacy of the players, as a condition to enter the country.  The tournament itself may still proceed, but without any involvement of Valve or the Dota Pro Circuit. This isn&#8217;t a reflection on how we feel about fans in the Philippines, and we are sorry for those that were planning on attending the event. </p>
<p>As a result, we’re talking to tournament organizers to try to find a way to run a Major with the invited and qualifying teams, including the Pro Circuit points that would have been available in Galaxy Battles 2018.</p>

<p>For too many seasons have the horrors of The Greeviling and Wraith Night kept our formerly festive heroes huddled near the warmth and safety of an Ancient&#8217;s glow. But this year a handful of heroes have gathered to ensure the true Frostivus spirit emerges from the traumas of the past.</p>
<p>To kick off the season, today&#8217;s update unveils an all-new Frostivus Treasure, filled with 18 community-created item sets and offering the chance to unlock a Rare Batrider set, Very Rare Wraith King set, or Extremely Rare Puck set.</p>
<p>And what would Frostivus be without a return of the Season of Givening?! This year, every player has the chance to earn one free Frostivus Treasure gift simply by going about business as usual. It&#8217;s easy — just win three games of Dota to claim your present.</p>
<p>Now to truly foster the holiday spirit and resurrect the tradition of the truce, everyone is invited to partake in the Frostivus Festival Special Event. Queue up to enter the fray and compete against friends and strangers alike in a madcap series of mini-games (randomly selected from a larger pool for each match) that will test your skills but never diminish your holiday cheer.</p>
<p>Please join us in offering a hearty congratulations to VicFrank, the Workshop contributor who created this winning entry and has secured the $30,000 grand prize. Thank you to all of the contributors who worked hard to help make this contest a resounding success.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s update reworks the Ranked matchmaking system, as our inaugural six-month Ranked Season is ready to begin. Entering the season, all players will be able to earn a new Rank Medal on their profile that represents their highest performance level for the current season. A Seasonal Rank Medal never decreases in rank once you&#8217;ve achieved it. Initial calibration games will be seeded roughly based on your previous skill. </p>
<p>There are seven levels of Rank Medals, and within each level are five stars of progress to earn towards the next Medal. These Medals are: Herald, Guardian, Crusader, Archon, Legend, Ancient, and Divine.</p>
<p>Your performance in both Party and Solo games is considered when evaluating your skill and determining when your Medal gets upgraded, with Solo games having a bigger impact. In order for players to achieve either the Ancient or Divine Medals, only Solo-game performance is considered. </p>
<p>This update also expands the Leaderboard system to include many more players. Players with 5 stars on the Divine Rank Medal (the highest rank) will now have a leaderboard number listed with the medal that broadcasts their position amongst other players. This leaderboard position will always be displayed alongside the Medal, and will be visible to all players in the game and on your profile.</p>
